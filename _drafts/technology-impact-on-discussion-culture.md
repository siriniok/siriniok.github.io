title: Technology Impact on Discussion Culture

I was wondering recently how communication technology impacts quality of group discussions. Do specific technologies make discussions more or less productive? Probably, you had wondered about that too after having a hot, but unproductive and grueling discussion on Twitter or some group chat.

For me the most frustrating aspect of such discussions is their intensity.

Unfortunately, I haven't found much research on this topic.

Some technologies make discussions more or less productive. My guess it mailby depends on the average message length / average message frequency

* blogs (as article responses, not comments)
* emails
* facebook
* twitter
* group chats

Taking few deep breaths probably would help. Alas. you can't force all participants to take a pause in the same time.

Will technology that artificially limits those two variables help to have more fruitfull discussions?
