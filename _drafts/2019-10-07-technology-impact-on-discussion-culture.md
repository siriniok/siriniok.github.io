Throughout the history of our civilization, the speed of long-distance communications tends to raise up. It started with messenger horses and pigeon post, and probably ended with video calls and chat messengers\[^1\]. I'd say conservatively, no one needs faster communications than we have today, and even if you can imagine something more rapid, like quantum telepathic networks organized through brain-computer interface, you will probably agree that our communication technologies are fast enough for our daily needs.

So nowadays we have everything in terms of speed and access, and that's what we usually call "the quality" of communication technology. But I want to talk today about one specific type of communication: a discussion; which is in my opinion is the most interesting and demanding type of communication.

A discussion is a conversation or debate about some topic. In essence, it didn't change much in the last 2500 years.

I was wondering recently how communication technologies impact quality of group discussions. Do specific technologies make discussions more or less productive? Probably, you had wondered about that too after having a hot, but unproductive and grueling discussion on Twitter or some group chat.e

My guess, it maybe depends on the average message length / average message frequency.

For me the most frustrating aspect of such discussions is their intensity.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Instant messaging lowers the bar to compose a message. I think this is not a good idea for collaboration. Composing a message should require more time and thought.</p>â€” Obstructed Goggles (@obsgog) <a href="https://twitter.com/obsgog/status/1109206383440875526?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 22, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Unfortunately, I haven't found much research on this topic, but from my experience I'd sort the popular communication means by their discussion quality in this order:

* blogs (as article responses, not comments)
* emails (including mailing lists)
* forums and Q&A sites
* facebook
* twitter
* group chats

I didn't include video calls into this list, because

Taking few deep breaths probably would help. Alas. you can't force all participants to take a pause in the same time.

Telegram adds slow mode

Will technology that artificially limits those two variables help to have more fruitfull discussions?  
  
Another solution that come to my attention is so called ["slow media"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_media) platforms like https://letter.wiki/about.

But it looks like it's useful only for very formal debates. Most of the discussions happen spontaniously in different places.

I believe there is a broad space of possibilities to solve this problem. As Naval Ravikant [once put it](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1099474932260495360), "The people designing the algorithms to shape online debate are now the most powerful people in the world". Please, share your ideas in comments.

\[^1\]: Amazing how it all started up with messengers and ended up with messengers too.
