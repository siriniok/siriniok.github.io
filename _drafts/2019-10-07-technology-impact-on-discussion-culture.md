Throughout the history of our civilization, the speed of long-distance communications tends to raise up. It started with messenger horses and pigeon post, and probably ended with video calls and chat messengers\[^1\]. I'd say conservatively, no one needs faster communications than we have today, and even if you can imagine something more rapid, like quantum telepathic networks organized through brain-computer interface, you will probably agree that our communication technologies are fast enough for our daily needs.

So nowadays we have everything in terms of speed and access. And it looks fine: what could possibly be bad in ability to communicate fast and freely? But only until it comes to **group discussions.**  
\----  
It never was appropriate for a good discussion to have more than one speaker at once. It's still not appropriate on  
  
For me the most frustrating aspect of such discussions is their intensity.  
  
You can manage this issue in voice discussions by raising your voice and asking everyone to shut the fuck up, but I don't remember a case when STFU ever worked on chats.

\---  
So, do specific technologies make discussions more or less productive? Probably, you had wondered about that too after having a hot, but unproductive and grueling discussion on the Internet. My guess, it mainly depends on **the average message length** **/** **average message frequency.

**The  
Taking few deep breaths probably can help. Alas, you can't force all participants to take a pause.**

**Unfortunately, I haven't found much research on this topic, but from my experience, I'd sort the popular text communication means by their discussion quality in this order:

* blogs (as article responses, not comments)
* emails (mailing lists)
* forums and Q&A sites
* facebook
* twitter
* chats

And seems like I'm not the only one who came to similar conclusions, I see people frustrated by this aspect of text communication quite often, e.g.:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Instant messaging lowers the bar to compose a message. I think this is not a good idea for collaboration. Composing a message should require more time and thought.</p>â€” Obstructed Goggles (@obsgog) <a href="https://twitter.com/obsgog/status/1109206383440875526?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 22, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Fortunately, I've already **the average message length** **/** **average message frequency.**

Will technology that artificially limits those two variables help to have more fruitfull discussions?

Another solution that come to my attention is so called ["slow media"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_media) platforms like [Letter Wiki](https://letter.wiki/). Or [Threads](https://threads.com/) with a similar concept for B2B.   
  
Existent platforms are also trying to mitigate this problem. For example, Telegram introduced "slow mode" for group chats: you can limit posting frequency to specific number of messages per hour.

But it looks like it's useful only for very formal debates. Most of the discussions happen spontaniously in different places.

I believe there is a broad space of possibilities to solve this problem. As Naval Ravikant [once put it](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1099474932260495360), "The people designing the algorithms to shape online debate are now the most powerful people in the world". Please, share your ideas in comments.
