Hi, everyone!

I'm Vlad Siriniok, a software engineer and entrepreneur from Kharkiv, Ukraine.

Like [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates) [other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg) [guys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman) in tech I dropped out of my university after a second year of study. And I have no regrets about that—tech universities in Ukraine is not the best place to actually learn something. But honestly, I've always dreamed about receiving a degree from an American university, like MIT or Berkeley.

Fortunately, [we're all living in America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8ljRgcJNM). I mean, today, in the era of the Internet, anyone has an access to a world-class education. Massive online courses, online degrees, whatever.

So since I've learned about MIT OCW I lived with a plan to complete MIT Undergraduate program in Computer Science using only MIT OCW materials. Later, I found an article written by [Scott H. Young](https://twitter.com/ScottHYoung) about [his experience](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/) in studying through the entire 4-year MIT computer science curriculum, without taking any classes. He finally motivated and convinced me in attainability of such crazy goal.

And today I begin ~~a new life~~ (finally)! Over the next few  years, I’m going to study through the entire 4-year MIT curriculum for computer science with help of materials available on MIT OCW.


## My Goals

1. Obtain fluency in math.
1. Improve my knowledge about software engineering and design.
1. Prepare myself to the deep dive into studying AI.
1. Improve my ability to read CS papers.
1. Develop an ability to write good essays and articles on computer science and tech topics in English.


## 6-3. Computer Science and Engineering Curriculum

I've used the latest [MIT curriculum](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/). Also, I used this [catalog](http://catalog.mit.edu/subjects/6/) to get pre- and co-requirements for the courses.

## Rules on Exams

I'm going to imitate the MIT's examination rules to get my self-assessments right. Here are some of them:

1. I will write the exams under the same time and material constraints (no looking at the questions or solutions beforehand, no notes or forbidden things). If the time constraints not specified I will try to pass exam in default 3 hours.
2. I have to get at least an 80% grade on final exam.
3. I will grade the papers myself, comparing them to the actual MIT solutions or answers on the Internet. I'm going to place my exam papers on Github, so anyone will be able to check my answers and grading.

## F.A.Q.

**1.** **How much you're gonna work during the challenge?**
It depends. I don't have a lot of time, but I want to study at least 12-16 hours per week.

**2.** **Do you have any plans to get an actual degree (from MIT or other college)?**
No, and it is not the point of this challenge, I rather have dreams than plans. But if you're living in the US and you're interested in getting a DIY degree, as fast as possible, then you can follow this [path](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2012/07/04/the-diy-degree/).
