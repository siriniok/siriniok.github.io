Hello, everyone!

My name is Vladyslav Siriniok, I'm a young software engineer and entrepreneur from Kharkiv, Ukraine.

Like [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates) [other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg) [guys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman) in tech I dropped out of my local university after a second year of study. And I have no regrets about that.

Needless to say, that tech education (and not only tech) in the ex-USSR countries barely useless and highly corrupt. If you live in the US or another developed country you can say "Yeah, I know what you feel, bruh, our universities are total shit too". But believe me, you can't even imagine how low is quality of education here. And honestly, I've always dreamed about graduating in some American university, like MIT or Stanford.

Fortunately, [we're all living in America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8ljRgcJNM). I mean, today, in the era of the Internet, anyone has access to world-class education. Massive online courses, online degrees, whatever.

So since I got to know about MIT OCW I lived with a plan to complete MIT Undergraduate program in Computer Science with help of only MIT OCW materials. Later, I found an article written by [Scott H. Young](https://twitter.com/ScottHYoung) about [his experience](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/) in learning the entire 4-year MIT curriculum for computer science, without taking any classes. It finally motivated and convinced me in possibility of such venture.

And today I start (finally) ~~a new life~~! Over the next 12-16 months, Iâ€™m going to learn the entire 4-year MIT curriculum for computer science with help of materials available on MIT OCW.


## My Goals

1. Obtain fluency in math.
2. Improve my knowledge about software engineering and design.
3. Prepare myself for deep dive into studying AI.
4. Improve my ability to read CS papers.
4. Develop ability to write good essays and articles on computer science and tech topics in English.


## My Curriculum for 6-3. Computer Science and Engineering

I designed my degree program myself. Yes, MIT provides a pretty flexible curriculum, where most of courses you can choose on your own. There are only few required classes and two lists with dozens of programs to choose. Also, I skipped humanities because I think MIT OCW is not the best place to take such courses and they don't correlate with my goals.


I had used the latest [MIT curriculum](http://www.eecs.mit.edu/curriculum2016). Also, I used this [catalog](http://catalog.mit.edu/subjects/6/) to get pre- and co-requirements for the courses.


### Intro

###### [6.001 Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/)
_\(Prereq: None\)_
May-June 2017

Actually, new curriculum requires modern 6.0001 program. But I don't want to learn basics of Python, so I replaced this one with legendary SICP course. There are two online versions of the book: [original](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) and [modern](http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/).

## Rules on Exams

I'm going to imitate the MIT's examination rules to get my self-assessments right. Here are some of them:

1. I will write the exams under the same time and material constraints (no looking at the questions or solutions beforehand, no notes or forbidden things). If the time constraints not specified I will try to pass exam in default 3 hours.
2. I have to get a grade on final exam of at least 60%.
3. I will grade the papers myself, comparing them to the actual MIT solutions. I'll place both on Google Drive, so anyone can double-check my grading methods.

## F.A.Q.

**1.** **How much I gonna work during the challenge?**
It depends. I don't have plenty of time, but I want to study at least 12-18 hours per week.

**2.** **Do you have any plans to get an actual degree (from MIT or other college)?**
No, and it is not a point of the challenge. I rather have dreams, than plans. But if you live in the US and you're interested in getting DIY degree, as fast as possible, you can follow this [article](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2012/07/04/the-diy-degree/) up.
