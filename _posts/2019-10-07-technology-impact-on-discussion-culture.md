Throughout the history of our civilization, the speed of long-distance communications tends to raise up. It started with messenger horses and pigeon post, and probably ended with SMS and chat messengers[^1].

I was wondering recently how communication technology impacts quality of group discussions. Do specific technologies make discussions more or less productive? Probably, you had wondered about that too after having a hot, but unproductive and grueling discussion on Twitter or some group chat.

For me the most frustrating aspect of such discussions is their intensity.

Some technologies make discussions more or less productive. My guess it mailby depends on the average message length / average message frequency. Unfortunately, I haven't found much research on this topic, but from my experience I'd sort the popular communication means in this order:

* blogs (as article responses, not comments)
* emails
* facebook
* twitter
* group chats

Taking few deep breaths probably would help. Alas. you can't force all participants to take a pause in the same time.

Telegram adds slow mode

Will technology that artificially limits those two variables help to have more fruitfull discussions?
